Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without a test scripting language.

In this repository, we will demonstrate a step by step approach using selenium to perform the following activities:
1. Testing a website
2. Reading Data from a website
3. Extracting Data from a social media platform - Facebook <br>
Web Scraping is used to extract the data from any websites on the internet that allows their users to scrape information and 
data within certain boundaries. Requests and BeautifulSoup are used to scrape data from static pages. Whereas, Selenium 
can be used to scrape data from dynamic pages.
