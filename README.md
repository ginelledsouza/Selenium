# Selenium

 is an open-source umbrella project for tools and libraries that supports web browser automation. 
Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without a test scripting language.
<br>
In this repository, we will demonstrate a step by step approach using selenium to perform the following activities:
1. Testing a website<br>
Testing website "https://pricebaba.com/" as an example for which we use selenium. Here we will test the following:
1.1 Main website load
1.2 Testing element hover capabilities
1.3 Clicking floatable elements
1.4 Returing to homepage 
1.5 Testing static elements
2. Reading Data from a website
3. Extracting Data from a social media platform - Facebook <br>
Web Scraping is used to extract the data from any websites on the internet that allows their users to scrape information and 
data within certain boundaries. Requests and BeautifulSoup are used to scrape data from static pages. Whereas, Selenium 
can be used to scrape data from dynamic pages.
